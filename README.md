Traffic Light

As of now Cars are arriving with usleep.

Cars are put are arriving at the set time.

Traffic light not yet implemented. 


When I add a line in CrossIntersection() to see if a car reaches this point, the line doesn't print out. When i add a additional line to see if the car is trying to release the lock it prints that the car reaches this point, then trys printing currentAction with garbage values and gives an error.
